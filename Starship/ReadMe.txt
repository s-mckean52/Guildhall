SD1-A3: Starship Gold

Known Issues / Items done differently:
    - There is an issue where the game window opens up behind other windows.
      Windows thinks that the window is still the focus so you have to select another
      window before reselecting the game.

    - When it came to rendering all of the objects on the screen I did it in a slightly
      different order. The lines that connect the asteroids and the bullets to the player
      ship are actually under the ship. This was done while rendering the asteroids and
      the bullets in order to not loop through all of them twice, once to render the object
      itself and the line that connects it to the ship.

    - 'O': Spawns a new asteroid at a random location.

    - The arrow keys control the movement of the player's ship. Pressing the up arrow accelerates the ship.
      The left and right arrow keys rotate in the respective direction; pressing both at the same time does
      not rotate ship.

    - The A button or RT will fire bullets

    - The Start button will start the game as well as respawn the player's ship when it is dead


Deep Learning:
        One thing that I tried to focus on during this project was clarity of code. When I was not
    stressed for time I found this easy to think about and actively try to improve. As I be came more
    worried about how much time was left, I found it was harder to write clear code. It was also hard
    to do this because there was already code writen. I fixed a lot of things as I went back through
    but found overhauling the entire project was not worth my time. Although I did not completely
    improve my inclanation toward procrastication, I did do some work on the project through out the
    2 weeks. This limited the time crunch at the end of the project and I felt less overwhelmed. This
    will be a constant struggle but I aim to gradually improve it by finding motivation to do work eaerly.
